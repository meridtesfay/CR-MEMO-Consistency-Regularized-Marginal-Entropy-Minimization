CR-MEMO: Consistency-Regularized Marginal Entropy Minimization

Author: Merid | Course: Deep Learning (Jan 2026)

🚀 Overview

This repository implements CR-MEMO, an enhancement of the MEMO algorithm (Zhang et al., NeurIPS 2022). This project focuses on Test-Time Adaptation (TTA), enabling pre-trained models to adapt to distribution shifts—such as natural corruptions (ImageNet-V2) and adversarial examples (ImageNet-A) —during inference using only the test point itself.
